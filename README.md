# luxon-date

A date abstraction over [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/).

You could represent dates with DateTimes, but that introduces a lot of uncertainty. This wrapper abstraction hides all time information,
so you are sure that all date operations are precise and time zone has no effect.

Built with TypeScript.

## Installation

```
yarn add luxon luxon-date
```
